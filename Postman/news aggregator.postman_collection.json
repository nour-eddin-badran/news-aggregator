Strong laws keep Australians safe.”</p> <p>The Australian Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, said that of the 138 people released as a result of the high court’s NZYQ decision some 132 have already had electronic monitoring ankle bracelets applied.</p> <p>Of the remaining six, Outram said four “have been referred to the federal police, that means there’s been non-compliance in those four cases”.

It was described as a “soul-shattering and true” novel that “captures the social and political anxieties of our current moment” by the judging chair, Esi Edugyan.</p> <p>Canadian novelist Edugyan, who has twice been shortlisted for the Booker prize herself, said the decision to award Lynch the £50,000 prize “wasn’t unanimous” and was settled on by discussion and multiple rounds of voting that lasted “about six hours” on Saturday.</p> <p>Prophet Song takes place in an alternate Dublin. Members of the newly formed secret police, established by a government turning towards totalitarianism, turn up on the doorstep of microbiologist Eilish asking for her husband, a senior official in the Teachers’ Union of Ireland. Soon, he disappears – along with hundreds of other civilians – and Eilish is left to look after their four children and her elderly father, fighting to hold the family together amid civil war.</p> <p>“It is with immense pleasure that I bring the Booker home to Ireland,” said Lynch, a former film critic, upon receiving the prize. “I had a moment on holiday in Sicily many years ago where I had this flash of recognition, I knew that I needed to write, and that was the direction my life had to take. I made that decision that day to just swerve, and I swerved. And I’m bloody glad I did.”</p> <p>His win comes days after <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/23/dublin-knife-attack-children-stabbing-ireland-parnell-square\\\">violent protests</a> broke out across central Dublin after a stabbing attack outside a primary school that left three children injured. Police said the disorder was caused by a “complete lunatic faction driven by far-right ideology”.</p> <p>Asked about his reaction to the events, Lynch said that he was “astonished” and at the same time “recognised the truth that this kind of energy is always there under the surface”.</p> <p>“I didn’t write this book to specifically say ‘here’s a warning’, I wrote the book to articulate the message that the things that are happening in this book are occurring timelessly throughout the ages, and maybe we need to deepen our own responses to that kind of idea,” Lynch said, later adding that he is “distinctly not a political novelist”.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/18/it-took-me-a-decade-the-2023-booker-prize-shortlisted-authors-on-the-stories-behind-their-novels\\\">‘The book took me about a decade’: the 2023 Booker prize shortlisted writers on the stories behind their novels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Edugyan said, when asked whether recent events had influenced the judges’ decision, that “at some point in the discussions, maybe for a few minutes, this was introduced, this was discussed”. However, she said that timeliness “was not the reason that Prophet Song won the prize” – the judges simply felt it was a “truly a masterful work of fiction”.</p> <p>This is the second year in a row that a novel about political conflict has won the prize.

His other novels are Beyond the Sea, Grace, The Black Snow and Red Sky in Morning. He is the fifth Irish author to win the prize, following in the footsteps of Iris Murdoch, John Banville, Roddy Doyle and Anne Enright. The Northern Irish writer Anna Burns won in 2018.</p> <p>Asked what he would spend the prize money on, Lynch said that “half of it has already gone” on his tracker mortgage.</p> <p>The keynote speech at the prize ceremony in London was given by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was released from prison in Tehran, Iran, last year. She discussed the ways in which books helped her when she was in solitary confinement. “When the guard opened the door and handed over the books to me, I felt liberated; I could read books, they could take me to another world, and that could transform my life,” she said.</p> <p>“One day a cellmate received a book through the post; it was The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood, translated into Farsi,” she said. “Who thought a book banned in Iran could find its way to prison through the post?”</p> <p>The other titles shortlisted for the prize were The Bee Sting by Paul Murray, Western Lane by Chetna Maroo, This Other Eden by Paul Harding, If I Survive You by Jonathan Escoffery and Study for Obedience by Sarah Bernstein.</p> <p>Alongside Edugyan on this year’s judging panel was actor Adjoa Andoh, poet Mary Jean Chan, writer and academic James Shapiro and actor Robert Webb. At the ceremony, Andoh read an extract from the 1990 Booker prize-winning novel Possession by AS Byatt, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/17/as-byatt-author-and-critic-dies-aged-87\\\">who died</a> earlier this month.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prophet Song by Paul Lynch (Oneworld £16.99).

The performative projection of strength and infallibility reaches a point of absurdity at which it starts to look like obvious weakness: brittle, slightly silly and too fragile to withstand even the slightest challenge. Power becomes paranoia – and it becomes impossible not to laugh.</p> <p>So it was with East Germany through the 1980s. The country struggled to establish much in the way of cultural soft power so sport became critical to the government’s sense of itself. Athletes were co-opted into the service of the state whether they liked it or not. “Medal intensive” sports such as track and field events and gymnastics were prioritised. There was a ruthless churn of contenders until the best prospects were identified. Many were pumped full of performance-enhancing drugs before being unleashed upon the sporting world like a squad of tracksuit-wearing Terminators.</p> <p>But in some (although not all) ways, football was different. Football – and the culture surrounding it – has a truculent, unbiddable quality. Football’s mass popularity and universal appeal makes it difficult to control in quite the same way. Still, as this fascinating documentary shows, that isn’t to say that no one tried. It’s just that happily, they didn’t quite succeed. Or at least, their success had huge, unintended consequences.</p> <p>We begin with the simultaneously nasty and pathetic figure of Erich Mielke. Mielke was the head of the East German secret police, the notorious Stasi. The Stasi specialised in close observation and interference; in infiltrating every aspect of East German life. At some point in the late 1970s, Mielke decided that it was the turn of his favoured football team, Berliner FC Dynamo (BFCD) to become successful. The best players found themselves inexorably nudged in their direction. Certain referees were chosen for crucial matches with predictable results. Much of the footage makes it hilariously clear that some games were effectively show trials – manipulated by officialdom until the “correct” outcome was arrived at.</p> <p>But all was not well. Using interviews with players and fans, Stasi FC traces the cracks in the facade as they widen. The first real wobble came in 1979 when BFCD midfielder Lutz Eigendorf sought political asylum after a game in West Germany. He left behind a wife and children in the East – who soon became intimately acquainted with the ways of the Stasi. Eigendorf himself didn’t have much better luck. He died, in what remains a mysterious and contested traffic accident, in 1983. That his fate didn’t dissuade other players from attempting similar escapes tells its own story – two other East German players later escaped to the West after slipping their state-appointed minder in a department store on an away trip. Amusingly, the minder seems to have been distracted from his duties by the trappings of western decadence that surrounded him.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"2cfa10c62ff01b54fcacf7288f06210788c35c8c\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cfa10c62ff01b54fcacf7288f06210788c35c8c/0_106_2880_1729/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Lutz Eigendorf’s car after a mysterious traffic accident in 1983.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Lutz Eigendorf’s car after a mysterious traffic accident in 1983.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Sky/Embankment Films/imago images/Rust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is around this point that a documentary about football becomes a documentary about pretty much everything but football. BFCD were, by the mid-80s, cruising to title after title. But, in a development that should have been surprising to absolutely no one – although it apparently was to Mielke – the choreography of success was getting boring. Furthermore, to the regime, it was getting dangerous, too. By 1987, as BFCD were celebrating their ninth consecutive title, their fans had started turning their backs on the pitch during games. As one fan says, by that point they “weren’t really there for the football”. By the following year, as the team achieved a tenth “triumph”, their fans could have travelled to the game in a single taxi. Elsewhere, crowd unrest and violence was growing – but in stark contrast to football hooliganism in the UK around this time, it was taking on a revolutionary and almost heroic quality.</p> <p>It’s hard to decide the extent to which this atmosphere of dissent fed into the events that followed. And wisely, the documentary pulls back from making any grandiose claims about football having brought down the Berlin Wall. But what does seem certain is that anti-BFCD feeling on the terraces began to feed into and interact with a more generalised anti-authoritarianism. The anonymity and relative safety in numbers provided by football fandom has always incubated a certain wildness – it’s striking to see that used as a force for good.</p> <p>As for BFCD, the club now competes in the fourth tier of German football. But it’s hard to imagine that despite this apparent fall from grace, supporting them now isn’t more fun. For Stasi FC, a certain redemption has been achieved in failure. And their tragicomic journey goes on.</p> <p>• Stasi FC aired on Sky Documentaries and is available on Now TV.</p>\",\n                \"cover_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/96879de87ac23a126e8a10dbd63903f4c47afe36/0_558_11098_6658/500.jpg\",\n                \"primary_link\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/p/pd99k\",\n                \"author\": \"Phil Harrison\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"published_at\": \"2023-11-26T22:30:30Z\",\n                \"category\": \"news\",\n                \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Australian super fund puts billions into backing Britain’s energy transition\",\n                \"content\": \"<p>The behemoth Australian fund IFM Investors will sink £10bn (A$19bn) into infrastructure and energy transition projects in Britain by 2027 as part of a new memorandum of understanding with the Sunak government.</p> <p>The decision by IFM – which is owned by 17 Australian industry super funds – comes as a coalition of business and environmental groups calls on the Albanese government to supercharge tax and other financial incentives to ensure Australia can attract sufficient capital to drive the domestic transition to net zero emissions.</p> <p>The MoU between IFM Investors and Britain’s minister for investment will be signed at the Global Investment Summit in London.

The state’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that it was believed at least 40 women and children were being detained in Gaza but were not being held by Hamas.</p> \\n<p>“If they get additional women and children, there will be an extension,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “We don’t yet have any clear information how many they can find because …  one of the purposes [of the pause] is they will have time to search for the rest of the missing people.”</p> \\n<p>A huge demonstration calling for the release of the hostages took place in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, with relatives of those still held increasingly assertive as a political force. The release of Edan, whose parents were killed in front of her while her older siblings hid in a cupboard, is an important moment in Israel.</p> \\n<p>“What she endured is unthinkable,” Biden said.</p> \\n<p>Liz Hirsh Naftali and Noa Naftali, her great-aunt and cousin, said: “We hoped and prayed today would come. There are no words to express our relief and gratitude that Abigail is safe and coming home … Today’s release proves that it’s possible. We can get all hostages back home. We have to keep pushing.”</p> \\n<p>Another hostage, Elma Avraham, 84, was seriously ill on arrival in Israel and taken straight to hospital by helicopter.</p> \\n<p>Hamas is thought to be split over extending the ceasefire, with political leaders based in Qatar favouring an extension but those in Gaza feeling that with almost 200 hostages still in their hands they are in a strong position and should resist any concessions. The group said in a statement on Sunday that it was seeking to extend the truce should serious efforts be made to increase the number of Palestinian detainees released from Israel.</p> \\n<p>The truce has brought the first significant pause in seven weeks of war marked by the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian violence in decades and vast destruction and displacement across the Gaza Strip.</p> \\n<p>The conflict was triggered when Hamas broke through the perimeter fence around Gaza on 7 October and attacked communities in southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians in their homes or at a music festival. More than 240 were abducted, including infants, elderly, disabled people, soldiers and foreign farm workers.</p> \\n<p>More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli offensive launched after the Hamas attack, roughly two-thirds of them women and children, according to the <a href=\\\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-health-ministry-health-death-toll-59470820308b31f1faf73c703400b033\\\">health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza</a>.

Many officials argue that Hamas only makes concessions when faced with overwhelming force, so the offensive should continue.</p> \\n<p>Observers and sources close to the negotiations said a major problem is the almost total absence of trust between Israel and Hamas.</p> \\n<p>Israel has accused Hamas of failing to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit hostages held in Gaza, while a coalition of groups representing hostages’ relatives criticised it for releasing children without their parents. Both were said to be breaches of the deal.</p> \\n<p>Osama Hamdan, a Hamas spokesperson, accused Israel on Sunday of allowing only 65 of 340 aid trucks that had entered Gaza since Friday to reach the north of the territory, or “less than half of what Israel agreed on”. Israel said it was Hamas that had stopped aid moving north.</p> \\n<p>The al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, also said Israel had failed to respect terms for the release of Palestinian prisoners that factored in their time in detention.</p> \\n<p>The Palestinians so far released by Israel included at least two women who had been given long sentences after being convicted by Israeli courts of violent attacks.

What remains, ultimately, is the way he made people feel.</p> <p>At Queens Park Rangers he will be remembered as the man who put the pride back into a small west London club. At Barcelona they remember him as the maverick foreign coach who ended a decade-long title drought and established them as a force again. For any England fan alive and sentient in 1996, he was the man who orchestrated the second great summer of love, a brocade of hazy memories and stinging emotions that stirred the national soul in a way only Alf Ramsey’s World Cup winners and Sarina Wiegman’s Lionesses have managed to do since.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image element--supporting\\\" data-media-id=\\\"879005b9d9ae72769c50c51652ac08e7bdae2f10\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879005b9d9ae72769c50c51652ac08e7bdae2f10/0_0_634_862/368.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"A young Pep Guardiola (left) looking up at Barcelona manager Terry Venables after their European Cup semi-final triumph against IFK Gothenburg in 1986.\\\" width=\\\"368\\\" height=\\\"500\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">A young Pep Guardiola (left) looking up at Barcelona manager Terry Venables after their European Cup semi-final triumph against IFK Gothenburg in 1986.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Colorsport/REX/Shutterstock.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His teams always boasted great individual talent, from Paul Gascoigne to Bernd Schuster to Gary Lineker to Tony Currie. But Venables was a team builder first and foremost, a coach who could make every player feel like they were the star. In an age of the dictatorial manager, Venables offered an arm around the shoulder, talked to players on their level, placed his gift in the service of theirs.</p> <p>Perhaps this is why Venables fits no particular intellectual tradition or coaching dynasty, is not identified with a particular tactic or style. But his influence runs a lot deeper than many assume. The famous 4-3-2-1 “Christmas Tree” formation he employed with England was repurposed to great effect by Aime Jacquet’s 1998 World Cup-winning French team. His dazzlingly original training sessions were revered by players and even copied by George Graham at Arsenal. Set-piece routines would be conceived and coached with all the rehearsed spontaneity of good music.</p> <p>At Barcelona he married English intensity with Catalan flair, taking his squad on a gruelling training camp in Andorra, burying himself in videotape analysis, crafting the high‑tempo pressing game that would shake a snoozing giant from its stupor and provide the blueprint for its later dominance. Among his most devoted students was a teenage La Masia midfielder called Josep Guardiola, for whom the arrival of Venables was the catalyst for a lifelong fascination with English football.</p> <p>A decade later, at a time when the English game was still in thrall to the idea of the dominant, alpha‑male centre-half, Venables trusted in a curious and cultured Aston Villa defender called Gareth Southgate. And in many ways the winding thread that took Southgate to the top of English football began with Venables, where he saw the way a skilful international coach could harness patriotism and loyalty to create a team greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>For all this, Venables was never really appreciated in his own time. Even at the apex of England’s Euro 96 bliss, the nation’s love for him was always somehow qualified and conditioned. Partly this reflects English football’s instinctive distrust of new ideas, its uneasy relationship with celebrity, its suspicion of the kind of unabashed self‑belief that Venables embodied. The Football Association never really wanted him as England manager, tried to shackle him while he was in the job and then effectively forced him out.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"03a9601e146cabfdbb10b964f76f64ee56b7d748\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03a9601e146cabfdbb10b964f76f64ee56b7d748/0_53_3504_2102/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Terry Venables as assistant coach with England\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Venables enjoyed a pure and simple vision of football as a single organic entity run by people who loved the game.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Tom Hevezi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps this is why the highlight of Venables’s coaching career was also his swansong. He was only 53 when he left the England job but achieved precious little afterwards. In 1998 the allegations of financial irregularity that had dogged him for years finally ended in 19 charges of serious misconduct and a <a href=\\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/venables-banned-as-company-director-for-seven-years-1138699.html\\\" title=\\\"\\\">seven-year ban on being a company director</a>. Abortive spells with Australia, Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Leeds, an ill‑fated takeover of Portsmouth, an extended dotage on the Costa Blanca: ultimately, none of this warrants anything more than a footnote.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/terry-venables-the-coach-who-saved-english-football-from-insularity\\\">Terry Venables, the coach who saved English football from insularity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there was Tottenham as well. In a way, those six turbulent years at his childhood club between 1987 and 1993 encapsulated the paradox of Venables, the businessman and the romantic, the messiah and the mess‑maker. Tottenham was all of Venables’s ambitions rolled into one: spine-tingling football and a seat on the board, a little boy’s playground where he could run amok on the training ground and the balance sheet. He rescued the club from bankruptcy, led the team to the 1991 FA Cup, fell out monumentally with his takeover partner, Alan Sugar, left under a cloud of financial mismanagement allegations and scorched bridges. He wanted to do it all, and left with nothing.</p> <p>Three decades on, the obsession with Venables’s pecuniary affairs feels somehow quaint in an age of state power, public investment funds and invisible billionaires. Yes, he bit off more than he could swallow. Yes, he made poor decisions, trusted the wrong people, bought too strongly into his own personal magnetism. Yes, he could be distastefully avaricious at times, seduced by the lure of a quick buck and a quick headline. No, he probably spread himself across too many roles to be truly great at any of them: player, coach, executive, celebrity.</p> <p>But at the heart of his many flaws was a pure and simple vision: a vision of football as a single organic entity, from the muddy turf to the boardroom, run by people who loved football and cared about its future, fuelled by an entrepreneurial spirit and industrial vats of self-belief.

But it’s also the very intimate, elemental story of one woman’s love for her family, and her desperate attempts to hold on to the immediate world around her in the face of rising chaos.</p> <p>Lynch imagines an Ireland that has fallen under fascist control. Eilish Stack is a Dublin scientist and mother of four, busy with work, family and her elderly father, averting her eyes from the increasingly worrying news reports. Then grim reality comes knocking at her door: the newly created secret police arrive to interrogate her husband, Larry, about his work as a trade unionist. Along with many others, he is disappeared into the maw of the state. Their teenage children want to take to the streets – to wear the colours of protest, to march, to fight back – but all Eilish wants is to keep them hidden and safe. As civil war breaks out, and the streets of Dublin are filled with roadblocks and snipers, she remains frozen in a state of denial. Her sister, who lives in Canada, begs her over the phone to try to escape. “History is a silent record of people who did not know when to leave.”</p> <p>If Prophet Song is a dystopia, then, like Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, it’s one whose events are already happening around the world. Families like Eilish’s are suffering in Ukraine, Syria, Palestine and elsewhere, refugees fleeing political violence, women’s rights violated across the globe, and the far right on the rise in Europe. The recent rioting in Dublin, and the shock and disbelief that greeted it, give the novel an uncomfortable extra timeliness.</p> <p>Lynch has described his book as “an attempt at radical empathy” – using fiction to break through the normalised, it-couldn’t-happen-here complacency of a western society saturated in global news. It is written in the present tense, in claustrophobic slabs of prose, with long immersive sentences increasing the feeling of inevitability. There are no quotation marks or paragraph breaks either – there is no breathing space for Eilish, no pause or respite in the nightmare. </p> <p>There’s an incantatory power to Lynch’s prose that’s reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy, but harnessed to a vision that is shockingly everyday, even as it summons the end times. This is a novel written to jolt the reader awake to truths we mostly cannot bear to admit: “All your life you’ve been asleep, all of us sleeping and now the great waking begins.”</p>\",\n                \"cover_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea462bd1fce2cc16d84f8971f2e135e52acf8367/197_214_5389_3233/500.jpg\",\n                \"primary_link\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/p/pdzxn\",\n                \"author\": \"Justine Jordan\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"published_at\": \"2023-11-26T21:53:47Z\",\n                \"category\": \"news\",\n                \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"title\": \"British Jews ‘will not be intimidated’, says chief rabbi at London march\",\n                \"content\": \"<p>Britain’s chief rabbi has said Jewish communities will not be intimidated by an increase in antisemitism, as tens of thousands marched in protest against a rising tide of hate triggered by the crisis in the Middle East.</p> \\n<p>The protest organisers had asked the far-right leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon to stay away, but he failed to, leading to his arrest by police.</p> \\n<p>Yaxley-Lennon, 40, better known as Tommy Robinson, was detained on Sunday after officers told him to leave the area.

She ran to a neighbor’s home for shelter, and the Brodutch family – mother Hagar and her three children – took Abigail in as the rampage raged. Then all five disappeared and were later confirmed to be captives. They were among the more than 200 people taken to Gaza in the attack that touched off the war.

In his debut year, he got all the way to the final with actress <strong>Molly Rainford.</strong> Now he reached week 10 with <strong>Angela Scanlon</strong>. It’s an enviable record.</p> <p>Angela jokes that Carlos is a “right old bossyboots” and he’s known as a tough taskmaster in training, but many of the pros are. He also forms a strong bond with his partners. He and Scanlon became endearingly close and laughed a lot, softening Carlos’ occasional tendency to make everything about him. Even tonight, his exit speech was longer than hers. Hey, at least he didn’t cry.</p> <p>He wasn’t afraid to choreograph challenging routines for Angela – see that Swan Lake paso and dramatic Argentine - and it usually paid off. It might be instructive to see how he fares with a less promising partner but for now, Carlos can be pretty satisfied with his two-series stint.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"2fd855a506371c3bb2b77b2d9d18ecfa845f5f1c\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fd855a506371c3bb2b77b2d9d18ecfa845f5f1c/0_32_3000_1800/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Angela Scanlon and Carlos Gu.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Angela Scanlon and Carlos Gu.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:13:06.498Z\\\">at 8.13pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-6563a4d68f0862dd912f5fa7\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:08:30.090Z\\\">8.08pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Angela Scanlon blew too hot and cold</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>It feels like a case of what might have been for Meath-born TV presenter <strong>Angela Scanlon</strong>. With her leggy high-energy, sparky personality and Gaelic dancing background, she was hotly tipped before the series began. An Irish version of <strong>Stacey Dooley</strong>, that was the hope. However, her contest never really got going.</p> <p>Ultimately, a lack of consistency proved Angela’s undoing. The only celebrity to finish both top and bottom of the standings, she never put together a run of strong routines. Her highlights were her leaderboard-topping Movie Week Charleston, her Swan Lake paso doble and that sizzling Argentine tango in the Tower Ballroom, which notched her first 10s.</p> <p>In between, though, she struggled with ballroom footwork, Latin flair and breathing through her nerves. There was also that strange mid-series moment when everyone became obsessed with the length of her arms, as if she was Mr Tickle.</p> <p>Typically for her rollercoaster series, she went from scoring 38 points in Blackpool to the exit door. She was unfortunate to get the technically tricky cha-cha this week. If she’d danced, say, a quickstep, salsa or a Couple’s Choice (which continues to be something of a free pass), she’d probably be safely through. The soundtrack didn’t help, with a disco track not quite suiting the cha-cha’s Cuban rhythms.</p> <p>As it is, she bows out with an impressive average score of over 30 points - and 10 samples of fabric for her two young daughters, who sweetly collected offcuts of her frock each week for their memory box. At least she’ll be home to open their advent calendars with them this week, rather than sweating in a training room. Steal the odd chocolate, Angela, you’ve earned it.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"27e2a30bcf90edad3769906c06061d907e8311fd\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27e2a30bcf90edad3769906c06061d907e8311fd/8_238_1973_2465/800.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Angela Scanlon’s cha cha.\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"1000\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Angela Scanlon’s cha cha.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:38:38.106Z\\\">at 8.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-6563a4508f08d11dcd253895\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:04:23.025Z\\\">8.04pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Sighs of relief for two boys</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Both <strong>Layton Williams</strong> and<strong> Nigel Harman </strong>will be counting themselves lucky tonight. There’s been a great deal of grumbling, understandably, about Layton’s prior dance experience. It looks like it could come back to bite him in the home stretch. </p> <p>A lack of public support meant that the first time he fell from the top spots into mid-table, he was consigned to the dance-off. <strong>Shirley Ballas</strong> saying she would have sent him home didn’t augur well either. On the upside, Musicals Week should suit him. He has plenty of West End experience, after all. Layton needs to start scoring in the high 30s again to give him a chance of making the final.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nigel once again has the public to thank for lifting him clear of danger. His smouldering but stiff rumba left him second from bottom on the scoreboard again. His scores have flatlined around the 33 or 34-point mark. His mistake-strewn routines mean he’s scored a handful of nines but mainly 8s and never a 10. Nigel needs to fix that fast. Again, Musicals Week might come at the right time for the theatre veteran.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\\\"block-6563a42e8f082789f67473b9\\\" class=\\\"block\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:02:00.849Z\\\">8.02pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Tune, though.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\\\"block-6563a3ef8f082789f67473ae\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:01:43.291Z\\\">8.01pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Angela and Carlos’ last dance</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>As the departing pair trip the light fantastic to Rule The World by Take That, the credits roll and their castmates descend to commiserate.

I was delighted to discover your blog to catch up on the judges’ comments and scores, with the added benefit of your insights.</p> <p>Although letting us see the whole show in Canada seems to be a no-no because of rights issues, the BBC does let us watch the individual dances as clips posted online after the show airs. Today was the first day I read your blog live, so I watched the dances, then went back to your blog for the comments and scores. It looks like that’s how I’ll be spending my Saturday and Sunday afternoons until the series ends! Thanks again. and keep blogging.”</p> <p>Our pleasure, Iain.

Ended a fine run of frockular form for the Russian-born firecracker.</p> <p><strong>Best judges’ comment:</strong> When random-scoring Anton stood up to do some rumba hip-thrusting, Craig drawled “Nobody needs to see that.”</p> <p><strong>Worst VT: </strong>Angela Scanlon’s slightly awkward girls’ night out. Bobby’s was genuinely moving.</p> <p><strong>Best Claudia quip: </strong>A quiet night for Winkle wit but the lack of her trademark fringe seemed to stun the tabloids. Let’s call it a coiffure quip. A tonsorial trolling.</p> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T21:44:00.209Z\\\">at 9.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-656259ae8f082789f6746c99\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T20:33:38.189Z\\\">8.33pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Angela Scanlon and Nigel Harman in dance-off danger</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>So <strong>Ellie Leach</strong> finishes top of the leaderboard, with <strong>Bobby Brazier</strong> in second.

No pressure. Ellie looking fabulously fiery in a red-and-black slashed geometric dress and getting into character with chair-ography to open. Being back in the smaller ballroom suits this intimate dance. Intense and passionate, very close hold, precise footwork and sizzling mood. Tom “Loki” Hiddleston said he was a fan of Ellie’s dancing this week. This is why. She walks up him in a somehow hot way. Gorgeous spins and sweeps. Utterly brilliant. Lingering embrace to end. Best dance of the night by far for me.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Bills, Bills Bills by Destiny’s Child. After last week’s Girls Aloud number, it’s the second girl group banger in a row for Ellie. The 1999 hit’s video was filming in a beauty salon as a tribute to Beyoncé’s beautician mum Tina, who owned a chain of hair salons and was the band’s stylist in their early days.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"94832315ccc2f47f3b4a36aec92bd8745464e3eb\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94832315ccc2f47f3b4a36aec92bd8745464e3eb/180_651_1640_2050/800.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Ellie Leach’s Argentine tango.\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"1000\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Ellie Leach’s Argentine tango.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T21:25:47.663Z\\\">at 9.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-656256a18f08d11dcd25314b\\\" class=\\\"block\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T20:19:44.586Z\\\">8.19pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>8, 9, 10, 10 for a total of 37 points.

It’s a routine dedicated to his late mother - reality TV star Jade Goody, who died from cervical cancer aged just 27 – portraying Bobby’s growth from losing her in boyhood. And also hailing his lovely dad Jeff. Shadow dance to start, then into some barefoot wafting. It’s contemporary fusion with modern ballroom touches. Emotional storytelling as you’d expect. A heartfelt, almost fairytale feel. The style of dance suits him. Timing off at times and a little flat-footed in sections but lovely lifts and emotional as all hell. Hell of a powerful ending. I’m welling up.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>This Woman’s Work by Maxwell. It’s the R&amp;B artist’s Kate Bush cover, originally performed for MTV Unplugged. The weepy 1988 original was about childbirth and written for John Hughes-directed romcom She’s Having A Baby. Bush directed the video herself and it starred Tom “Lord Percy/Captain Darling” Tim McInnerny.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"dfe3aa0f8dbc7cba8760ba998d4f914d2da785e9\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe3aa0f8dbc7cba8760ba998d4f914d2da785e9/345_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Bobby Brazier and Dianne Buswell.\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"1000\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Bobby Brazier and Dianne Buswell.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T21:29:01.845Z\\\">at 9.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-656254768f082789f6746c7c\\\" class=\\\"block\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T20:10:48.389Z\\\">8.10pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>7, 7, 8, 9 (really?) for a total of 31 points.

Three of them, to be precise, which must be a confidence builder. Can they maintain that standard? They might need to, because they’re one of bookies’ top tips for the exit this week. Big hair, looking fab, but not sure about the miming. It’s high-energy, sparkly and spicy. Sprinkler step and disco vibes. She’s been working hard on her straight legs but is missing those figure-of-eight hips. Sharp twists, turns and rhythmic action, but a tad awkward at times.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor. This disco anthem and karaoke classic topped the UK singles chart in 1979. It was originally a B-side, hence being recorded in just 35 minutes. Gaynor was wearing a back brace as she sang it, having just had surgery due to a fall at a concert. It soundtracked Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice’s cha-cha in the 2015 semi-final.</p> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-26T20:49:04.488Z\\\">at 8.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-656252748f08d11dcd25313a\\\" class=\\\"block\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T20:02:35.664Z\\\">8.02pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>8, 9, 9, 10 (oh Anton) for a total of 36 points.

Upright shape, elbows out. Flamenco foot stamps and swishy skirt-ography. She’s slid around on the floor as the cape. A few footwork issues and lacking some curve but superb mood and high kicks. Olé!

Can he make amends and get over the disappointment? The rumba is slow, exposing and notoriously tricky for celebrity males. Tear-jerking storytelling about a man who has lost his partner and dances with her spirit - “a bit like Ghost without the pottery”, said Nigel this week. It’s staged among grey drapes in silvery outfits and the wind machine is deployed. Earthy, ethereal and emotional. Needs fluidity and flow, so he’s got keep those Patrick Swayze hips moving. A lot of walking around and pose-striking for me but it got into gear eventually. Great soppy storytelling but lacked a little sexy rumba-ness.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>It’s All Coming Back To Me Now by Celine Dion. The melodramatic 1996 power ballad was written by Jim Steinman, inspired by Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights. It was offered to Bonnie Tyler and Meat Loaf was keen to record it but Steinman saw it as “a woman’s song”. Andrew Lloyd Webber once told Steinman it was “the greatest love song ever written”. Steady on, Lord LW.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"f1c64f62a8637b46b4ac7a1a5914be465fb9b135\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c64f62a8637b46b4ac7a1a5914be465fb9b135/769_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Katya Jones and Nigel Harman.\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"1000\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Katya Jones and Nigel Harman.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T21:36:03.437Z\\\">at 9.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-65624e8b8f08d11dcd25311b\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2023-11-25T19:45:16.479Z\\\">7.45pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">David Tennant on the Ts &amp; Cs</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Back to the balcony this week after Blackpool’s improvised “corner behind a glittery curtain” Clauditorium but the Ts&amp;Cs are on VT – with good reason.

Can they go one better? They still haven’t scored a 10 for a ballroom dance. Layton is in a hot pink waistcoat with wide leg culottes. Wacky opening, then into hold. The choreography combines waltz, foxtrot and jazz. Layton has been working hard on his footwork and smooth transitions. Freedom in the solo sections but they need to fly flat in hold. High kicks. Confetti-filled balloon trick. Slightly ahead of the beat at times but cute, as hell and fab-ew-lous. They cheekily shush Craig at the end, which is… courageous.</p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> It’s Oh So Quiet by Björk. The 1940s German jazz song was covered by the Icelandic pop pixie in 1995 and became her biggest hit. Spike Jonze directed the video in the style of a Hollywood Technicolor musical and this routine is channelling that exuberant mood.

Then, less than 24 hours after toppling Novak Djokovic twice in one day, Jannik Sinner again demonstrated nerves of steel as he closed off the best two weeks of his career by dominating Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-0.</p> \\n<aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/25/italy-into-davis-cup-final-after-sinners-stunning-comeback-sees-off-djokovic\\\">Italy into Davis Cup final after Sinner’s stunning comeback sees off Djokovic</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>“This is a really important win for me and for the whole team and Italy together, no?

Obviously, everyone is really happy about the end result.”</p> \\n<p>The tie was dictated by a brutal opening encounter, a must win for both teams because of the dominance of Sinner and the Australian doubles team. Arnaldi and Popyrin, two younger players who have yet to break the top 35, were thrust into an enormous occasion for which nothing in their career had prepared them.</p> \\n<p>The contest was decided by Arnaldi’s sheer stubbornness and resilience. The Italian was thoroughly outplayed throughout the third set, facing break points in four of his five service games and eight in total. His easiest hold in the entire set was from 15‑30 down as the Australian eased through his own service games.</p> \\n<p>Somehow, Arnaldi kept hold of his serve, playing fearlessly on the break points, and he kept the set on serve long enough for Popyrin to feel pressured by the scoreboard.

He attacked relentlessly off both wings, spraying winners from all parts of the court, and it soon turned into a rout. For all the improvements De Minaur has made this year, the Australian does not have the weapons or the variety to disrupt a dialled-in Sinner’s game. De Minaur’s admirable attempts to take the ball early and attack only played into Sinner’s hands, providing the Italian with the pace he loves to feed off.</p> \\n<p>Sinner ended an astonishing few weeks with a stream of brutal, untouchable winners, underlining his arrival at the top levels of the sport and his ability to fight for, and win, the biggest titles in the world.</p> \\n<p>As the Italian team sprinted on to the court to celebrate their title, their victory came with a warning.

In a blistering response Cohen faulted Varadkar for not using the word “kidnap” and not naming <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas\\\">Hamas</a>, which killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 200 in southern Israel on 7 October.</p> <p>“Mr Prime Minister, it seems you have lost your moral compass and need a reality check,” he <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/elicoh1/status/1728685981379731925?s=20\\\">wrote on X</a>, formerly Twitter. “Emily Hand was not ‘lost’, she was kidnapped by a terror organisation worse than Isis that murdered her stepmother.

Israel has previously accused Ireland of <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/20/ireland-palestine-ceasefire-gaza\\\">pro-Palestinian bias</a> but Irish officials had expected Emily’s release to be a moment of mutual satisfaction.</p> <p>Varadkar and Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, had met Emily’s family and Martin flagged her case on a visit to Egypt and Israel.</p> <p>Martin said he was “genuinely surprised” at the row. Varadkar said: “I think the vast majority of people understand what I was saying, recalling the amazing joy and awe that occurs when a child comes home.”</p> <p>The enterprise minister, Simon Coveney, urged people to read Varadkar’s original statement in full. “Being lost and found is a biblical term effectively that he was using in a tweet,” he told RTÉ. Some Israeli commentators on social media said the biblical reference was additional reason for offence because it was from the New Testament.</p> <p>The spat came after the Israeli foreign ministry summoned the ambassadors of Spain and Belgium for a “harsh rebuke” over comments by the two countries’ leaders, accusing them of supporting “terrorism”.</p> <p>All three countries, along with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, have been calling for “urgent” humanitarian aid to Gaza and the end of killing of innocent civilians.</p> <p>Visiting the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Friday with the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, Spain’s Pedro Sánchez said the “indiscriminate killings of innocent civilians” in the Palestinian territory was “completely unacceptable”.</p> <p>Both leaders called for a permanent ceasefire in the war-battered territory, with the Belgian premier also denouncing the destruction in the Gaza Strip as “unacceptable”.</p> <p>Spain’s prime minister rejected the Israel criticism. “Condemning the vile terrorist attacks of a terrorist group like Hamas, and at the same condemning the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians in Gaza, is not a question of political parties nor of ideology, it is a question of being humane,” Sánchez told a gathering of his Socialist party in Madrid, earning applause from the audience.</p> <p>The Spanish foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, has in turn called in the Israeli ambassador to lodge a formal protest against the Israeli government’s allegations.<br></p>\",\n                \"cover_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f63edb7f19653f994ee18d0cdaffd0df509b77a/3156_575_3749_2250/500.jpg\",\n                \"primary_link\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/p/pdp9b\",\n                \"author\": \"Rory Carroll,Lisa O'Carroll\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"published_at\": \"2023-11-26T19:54:13Z\",\n                \"category\": \"news\",\n                \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"title\": \"‘Overjoyed’: nine-year-old hostage Emily Hand returns to family in Israel\",\n                \"content\": \"<p>The family and friends of Emily Hand have spoken of their joy after Hamas released the nine-year-old Israeli-Irish girl from captivity in Gaza late on Saturday.</p> <p>“Emily has come back to us,” her father, Thomas Hand, said after an emotional reunion at a hospital in Israel.</p> <p>In a statement, Emily’s family said: “We can’t find the words to describe our emotions after 50 challenging and complicated days.”</p> <p>Later on Sunday, her father gave an update on her recovery: “She has lost a lot of weight, from her face and body, but generally doing better than we expected.</p> <p>“We’d like to thank everyone that has helped and supported us throughout this whole 50 days.

The Route One-ists favoured howitzer football: native aggression and directness with minimal elaboration. Idealists fought for the global mainstream of sophistication. In the middle of this battle stood Terence Frederick Venables, a myth to his enemies, a prophet without honour in his own land to his disciples.</p> \\n<aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/terry-venables-obituary\\\">Terry Venables obituary</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The messiah coach who would save English football from its insularity was never in one place long enough to file a body of work sufficiently convincing to defeat his critics. His often chaotic and sometimes dubious attempts to prove himself a visionary businessman ultimately sabotaged his intermittent efforts to be the coach for which his country yearned.</p> \\n<p>But that craving was real, especially after the recidivism of the Graham Taylor years, when the progress made by Bobby Robson’s side at Italia 90 was torpedoed by Football Association mandarins with no interest in continuity of playing styles. If the meteor blaze of Paul Gascoigne exposed the fallacy that English spectators were content to see football played above head height, the entertainment conceived by Venables at the 1996 European Championship answered another deep wish.</p> \\n<p>To be loved by an English crowd in the 1980s or 90s, a manager would ideally be relatable, streetwise, twinkly and positive: an entertainer with a swagger and the same level of tactical knowledge as the best in Europe. The applause for Venables at Premier League grounds on the day of his death spoke of an inbuilt admiration for the anti‑establishment football romantic who took over Taylor’s ruined England and turned them into the swashbucklers who <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/29/england-holland-euro-96-4-1-football-when-came-home-paul-gascoigne-terry-venables\\\" title=\\\"\\\">beat the Netherlands 4-1 at Euro 96</a>.</p> \\n<p>Venables is miscast as a dreamer. Before that European Championship he said: “In all the debate about the state of English football, one factor is consistently forgotten. It is the character of the English player.” He gave artists and artisans equal value. The elusive, elastic running of Darren Anderton or Steve McManaman was enabled by the alpha‑maledom of Tony Adams and Paul Ince and the certainty of Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham.</p> \\n<p>Art for art’s sake, it was not. Don Howe, the defensive guru, was his right‑hand man. In restaurants with the salt and pepper pots El Tel<em>,</em> as he came to be known in Barcelona, talked almost as much about shutting down the opposition as he did sweeping them off the pitch. The intellectual challenge of coaching and his talent for managing people – for making the job of the footballer intensely enjoyable – was the addiction that kept luring him back to the dugout while his “investment schemes” were burning up his time.</p> \\n<figure class=\\\"element element-atom\\\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\\\"9edff84c-1f4e-43d7-9a7b-1b2e8c64b851\\\" data-atom-type=\\\"media\\\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aXnh5EAZygI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\\\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>In his era, and in his character, Venables absorbed the angst of a nation hung up on 1966 but still in the early years of the Premier League revolution, before an influx of foreign players and managers transformed the English game in style, tone and spirit. In Venables’s time the conversation was still internal: the mother country arguing with itself. The choice was binary. In the industry you were either for Venables or against him. The “friends of Terry” became shorthand for the division in a media camp that hung on his every word, either in admiration or to jump on a flaw. Visionaries and reformers in other countries didn’t seem to have such complicated lives.</p> \\n<p>In retrospect, a football manager who had to pulp his own autobiography, was upbraided for “deliberately and dishonestly” misleading a jury and was banned from being a company director was never likely to be remembered solely as a tracksuit thinker. But Venables could be mesmerising company. The more time you spent with him the more you noticed his hyper‑vigilant need for knowledge. Between comic anecdotes and tactical asides he would poke and prod everyone around the table for bits of information on this player, that chairman, this or that club. Behind the lights of his smile, his love for singing Frank Sinatra songs and his wise-guy self‑regard, Venables possessed a football brain with no off-switch. He was always alive to the next opportunity, the ever-present need to stay ahead of the hounds.</p> \\n<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"140b6652327a058104dc39844821288801e2bde5\\\"> \\n <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/140b6652327a058104dc39844821288801e2bde5/0_0_3143_2095/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Venables with Paul Gascoigne prior to England’s shoot-out win over Spain.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"667\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\"> \\n <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Venables’ career highlight with England also turned out to be his swansong after leaving the job at the age of 53.

It was what they wanted, they all said: an escape from their own deadening history. With England and at Barcelona, in both cases briefly, Venables’s gift for understanding human nature in the pressurised context of elite football combined with the eye he had for the workings of the game to produce flourishes entirely in sync with his own character: cunning, restless, exuberant, unapologetic.</p> \\n<p>After Euro 96, nobody noticed that he had not nominated penalty takers for the semi-final penalty shootout against Germany beyond spot-kick No 5: an error that allowed Gareth Southgate to volunteer to go next, out of duty rather than judgment. Southgate failed to score, and Venables’s short reign of 24 England games from March 1994 to June 1996 was over. While lawyers salivated over fees from his legal entanglements, Euro 96 embedded itself in the English psyche as a brief enchantment, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/05/never-stopped-me-dreaming-how-euro-96-illuminated-our-world\\\" title=\\\"\\\">a rebirth for the national team</a> and a riposte to the FA blazers who mistrusted Venables while trying to build a commercial revolution on the popularity of his 1996 team.</p> \\n<p>Too distracted and flighty to be a statesman, Venables nevertheless worked best in the realm of the imagination – in inspiration – which isn’t something you would say of many England managers. There was a time when his 4-3-2-1 formation seemed so exotic that people called it the “Christmas tree”. Now, it’s a standard team shape. If you didn’t like that one, Venables had others. He was never short of tricks.</p>\",\n                \"cover_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4522bde408597117f98a8ce1909249c99507d2f/0_163_4680_2808/500.jpg\",\n                \"primary_link\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/p/pdp8d\",\n                \"author\": \"Paul Hayward\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"published_at\": \"2023-11-26T19:44:39Z\",\n                \"category\": \"news\",\n                \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Three Palestinian students shot and wounded in Vermont, police say\",\n                \"content\": \"<p>Three college students described as being of Palestinian descent were <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hzomlot/status/1728786084308373539\\\">shot </a>and wounded on Saturday evening in Burlington, Vermont, on their way to a family dinner.</p> <p>The head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hzomlot\\\">Husam Zomlot</a>, identified the victims as Hisham Awartani, Tahseen Ahmed and Kinnan Abdalhamid, undergraduate students at Brown, Haverford and Trinity.

They’ve had plenty of practice in recent years, of course, but, still, there was something viscerally impressive abo ut the boos before kick-off. It began as a low moan, like the agonised groan of a brontosaurus dying in a distant valley, then built slowly, rumbling mournfully through the old stadium, gaining in depth and plaintiveness and volume to finally break in a mighty foghorn of despair summoned from the guts of all Evertonians.</p> \\n<p>They had already booed the two blokes in dark rain-jackets who brought out the Premier League signage, as well as the six ballboys who, with an understandable degree of hesitation, unfurled the Premier League flag.</p> \\n<aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2023/nov/26/power-greed-and-money-everton-fans-vent-anger-at-premier-league-in-pictures\\\">‘Power, greed and money’: Everton fans vent anger at Premier League – in pictures</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Poor John Brooks, the referee, was booed as a representative of the evil empire that has done Everton down before even blowing for kick-off. By half-time, he was being booed and denounced as unfit to referee for the more conventional reason of booking Abdoulaye Doucouré but not Scott McTominay or Bruno Fernandes. And within 11 minutes of the start of the second half, the boos directed at Brooks blended gloom with fury, as he overturned the yellow card given to Anthony Martial for diving to award a penalty.</p> \\n<p>They booed in accordance with the pre-game plan on 10 minutes, as the stands – as they had been as the teams took the pitch – bristled with the lurid pink cards bearing the Premier League lion and the single word “Corrupt” that had been distributed outside the ground. No one should be in any doubt about the unanimity of anger against the 10-point deduction.</p> \\n<p>As was always likely, the mood was of standing against a common enemy. County Road had to be closed to traffic as fans gathered to protest, demonstrating a fervent togetherness not usually seen at Goodison until the threat of relegation really begins to bite around Easter. A barrage of fireworks was let off in the street outside after about 13 minutes, presumably part of the protest, although its precise relevance was unclear.</p> \\n<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"3f661b07b1b43d560e86dc262d5a806685140bcf\\\"> \\n <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f661b07b1b43d560e86dc262d5a806685140bcf/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Everton fans ahead of the march towards Goodison Park.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"667\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\"> \\n <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Everton fans ahead of the march towards Goodison Park.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The chants against the Premier League were many and varied, although the general message was consistent: “Premier League, what’s the score?”, “Premier League, corrupt as fuck”. Manchester United fans responded with, “You cheating bastards, you know what you are”. As they should: banter about the regulatory enforcement of financial caps is the very essence of the modern game.</p> \\n<p>One banner in the Gwladys Street End read: “Where there is power, greed and money … there is corruption”, while another made seemingly specific reference to the suggestion in <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/andy-burnham-hits-out-at-premier-league-everton-penalty-abuse-of-process\\\" title=\\\"\\\">the statement from Andy Burnham</a>, the Everton‑supporting mayor of Greater Manchester, that the Premier League had discussed the sanction against Everton in relation to the coming independent regulator, the implication being that the penalty was exemplary and political rather than deriving from pre-existing principle.</p> \\n<p>However robust Everton’s defiance, there has been a sense this weekend that things are just running against them. The one consolation of the points deduction was that it pushed Everton back into the dogfight when in other seasons it might have cast them adrift. But then Luton chose this weekend <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/luton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\\\" title=\\\"\\\">to claim their first home win</a> of the season and <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/sheffield-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\\\" title=\\\"\\\">Bournemouth their first away</a>. The situation looked far worse at kick-off than it had done on Saturday morning.</p> \\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\\\" title=\\\"\\\">It soon got even worse</a>. Within three minutes Alejandro Garnacho had thrashed a bicycle kick into the top corner: it’s been a while since anyone at Goodison had such control of their overheads. It quickly became apparent that this was one of those days when nothing would go right. In his United career, André Onana has been a curious mix of sharp reflexes and inopportune dematerialisation. Here it was the former to the fore as he made a fine double save before the clearance was completed by Kobbie Mainoo.</p> \\n<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"57168401dcf24b9f58af60cb1fa2a5a1e9c430d6\\\"> \\n <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57168401dcf24b9f58af60cb1fa2a5a1e9c430d6/0_328_6000_3600/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Fans make their feelings clear during the match at Goodison Park.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\"> \\n <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Fans make their feelings clear during the match at Goodison Park.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The 18-year-old Mainoo impressed in the summer but injury meant this was his first appearance of the season. He looks an enormous talent but why, Everton fans were entitled to ask, did he have to announce himself against them? Why did it have to be today that Marcus Rashford scored his first club goal in almost three months? Or that Anthony Martial scored his first league goal since May (even if he is a specialist, having scored more against Everton than any other club)? That goal happened to come in United’s last league win by more than a single goal – before Sunday.</p> \\n<p>And that’s without mentioning all the chances that Everton spurned in the first half. In the end they were beaten comfortably enough but, before the penalty, it could easily have gone the other way.</p> \\n<p>That’s what they have to hang on to. It would, obviously, have been better to have begun the resistance with a win, particularly given the difficulty of the fixture list over the next month. But they will not have many games in which the fates are so decisively against them.</p> \\n<p>The improvements under Sean Dyche should still be enough to keep them up if they can maintain the galvanising spirit of righteous fury. Win or lose, they have to be on the boos.</p>\",\n                \"cover_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/57168401dcf24b9f58af60cb1fa2a5a1e9c430d6/0_326_6000_3600/500.jpg\",\n                \"primary_link\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/p/pdy22\",\n                \"author\": \"Jonathan Wilson\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"published_at\": \"2023-11-26T19:27:57Z\",\n                \"category\": \"news\",\n                \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"title\": \"Labour would cut net migration to 200,000 a year, says shadow minister\",\n                \"content\": \"<p>A Labour government would cut net migration to a “couple of hundred thousand a year” within its first term, a shadow cabinet minister has said.</p> <p>The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, said the party intended to get net migration back to “normal levels”, as figures are “extremely high”.</p> <p>The latest official figures published last week showed the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/23/net-migration-to-uk-hit-record-745000-in-2022-revised-figures-show\\\">had risen to 745,000</a>, three times higher than the level before Brexit.</p> <p>The increase is largely down to a rise in people coming to the UK to work in the health and social care sectors.</p> <p>The Conservative party’s 2019 manifesto vowed “overall numbers will come down” and “we will ensure that the British people are always in control”.</p> <p>But Rishi Sunak is under growing pressure to come up with an “immediate and massive” plan to cut net migration levels.</p> <p>When asked on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg if Labour could bring numbers down within the first term of a government, Jones said: “I think we probably would hope to do that, yes, but we’ve talked about a decade of national renewal.”</p> <p>He said it would take “some time to fix the deep structural problems” left by successive Conservative governments. He also noted the Conservatives had “set targets and caps and have failed every single year”. David Cameron vowed to reduce net migration to “tens of thousands” a year in 2010. Theresa May also promised to bring net migration to under 100,000 a year, which she said was a “sustainable” level post-Brexit.</p> <p>When asked what represented a reasonable level of net migration, Jones said: “The normal level is a couple of hundred thousand a year, but it depends on the needs in the economy.”</p> <p>A Labour spokesperson later said the party would not set an “arbitrary target” on migration.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had earlier told the <a href=\\\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-pledge-to-raise-salary-bar-for-skilled-workers-visa-vmktzmj67\\\">Sunday Times</a> Labour would increase salary requirements for workers coming from overseas. She said the party would change current rules that allow employers to pay migrant workers 20% less than the annual salary threshold of £26,200 for roles on the shortage occupation list.</p> <p>Sunak reportedly agreed to increase the minimum salary threshold as part of a leadership contest agreement with Suella Braverman. The prime minister agreed a “four-point migration plan” with the former home secretary, the Daily Telegraph reported, one of which was to raise the minimum to £40,000.</p> <p>Meanwhile, remarks by the home secretary, James Cleverely, urging people not to “fixate” on the government’s Rwanda deportation plan have angered many Conservative MPs who believe the prime minister is not going fast and far enough on immigration.</p> <p>The chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, tried to play down suggestions of a cabinet split, but a Conservative source said: “They’re in total chaos right now.</p> <p>“They physically can’t get a bill together. Alex [Chalk, the justice secretary] and Victoria [Prentis, the attorney general] have been clear on their views. Robert [Jenrick, the immigration minister] on his. The lack of a bill emerging is a symbol of how weak No 10 is at the minute.”</p> <p>Trott refused to spell out new short-term plans to bring the numbers down, despite claiming immigration levels were too high.</p> <p>“This year we brought forward a £600m plan to train more people to do social care in this country,” she told Kuenssberg. “So we are taking concrete steps, I’m not just saying here I want it to come down, I’m saying that we are taking concrete steps to bring it down.” </p> <p>Jenrick is understood to have worked up a plan designed to appease calls from rightwing Tories who are pushing for a ban on foreign social care workers bringing in any dependants, and a cap on the total number of NHS and social care visas.</p>\",\n                \"cover_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/98490c54bb238f6be2f8100b8126c7ebedf6e290/0_404_2802_1680/500.jpg\",\n                \"primary_link\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/p/pdp4k\",\n                \"author\": \"Aletha Adu\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pagination\": {\n            \"pagination\": {\n                \"total\": 172,\n                \"page_size\": 20,\n                \"page\": 0\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"metaData\": {\n        \"status\": 200,\n        \"message\": null,\n        \"key\": \"success\",\n        \"error_id\": null\n    }\n}"
