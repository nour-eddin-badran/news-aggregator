# System Design

### Methodology

A concise overview of the methodology adopted in developing the application:

* Utilizing the strategy design pattern, three distinct news providers have been successfully implemented. This approach provides flexibility to extend the system and incorporate additional providers easily.
### Main Business Logic
The main business logic is located in the following namespace:

```
App\Modules\NewsProviders
```

* For storage, a hybrid approach using both relational and non-relational databases has been adopted. Scraped data is stored in Elasticsearch, offering flexibility for filtering and quick storage or retrieval. Other data, such as authentication details, user preferences, and related information, is managed in MariaDB. This combination ensures optimal performance and data organization.

### Main Scraper Class
The main scraper class, triggering all processes, is located in the following namespace:

```
App\Modules\NewsScraper
```

### Main Elasticsearch Service

The primary Elasticsearch service is located in the following namespace:

```
App\Services\Elasticsearch
```
